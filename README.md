# "Bakery" demo for Digiloikka Oy

This project uses Next.js, Redux Toolkit, and TypeScript. The app was initialized using [these instructions](https://react-redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started). Tools used during development: Node.js v.18.18.1, Windows 11 Home (22H2), Visual Studio Code, and Git Bash for Windows.

## Usage

Launch the app locally with

```
npm run dev
```

### Code formatting

This project uses ESLint and Prettier and is configured to format code on save/paste when VSCode is used with recommended extensions. This _should_ work out-of-the box but is not verified on another machine.

### Troubleshoot

If you see the following error with e.g. `React.PropsWithChildren` or any other import 

```
Type annotations can only be used in TypeScript files.ts(8010)
```

disable the builtin extension _TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features_ - this does not disable ESLint.

## Requirements

This should preferably be in some project management system e.g. Jira.
